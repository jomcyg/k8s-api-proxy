Note: For this tutorial, you don't install and verify the certificate of the Kubernetes API server. Instead, you run the curl command with the -k (insecure) option. In a production environment, you should properly install and verify TLS certificates. For more information, see manage TLS certificates in Kubernetes clusters.
